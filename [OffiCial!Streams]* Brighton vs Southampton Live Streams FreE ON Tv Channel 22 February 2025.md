Improving Brighton will look to keep up their momentum in this all-south coast clash at St. Mary's against rock-bottom Southampton. 

The visitors have bounced back well from their 7-0 humiliation at the hands of Nottingham Forest at the start of the month with back-to-back wins at home against Chelsea in the FA Cup and in the English Premier League. 

With just 9 points to their name so far this season, the hosts are in need of a miracle if they're to avoid heading straight back to the Championship. On the evidence of their 3-1 capitulation at home to Bournemouth last weekend, it seems unlikely that local bragging rights will be with the Saints come full time on Saturday. 

Southampton take on Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday, Feb. 22, at St. Mary's Stadium, with kickoff set for 3 p.m. GMT local time. That makes it a 10 a.m. ET or 7 a.m. PT start in the US and Canada, and a 2 a.m. AEDT kickoff in Australia in the early hours of Sunday morning. 

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the match as it happens, wherever you are in the world.

How to watch the Premier League 2024-25 season from anywhere with a VPN
If you find yourself unable to view EPL matches locally, you may need a different way to watch the games -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins. 

With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this. 

Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions. 

Can I livestream Southampton vs. Brighton in the UK?
No broadcaster has the rights to show this game live in the UK, due to the traditional Saturday 3 p.m. kickoff blackout, which prohibits matches from being shown in the region at that time to protect attendances throughout the English football pyramid. 

That also means that if you're in the UK traveling for pleasure or for work, you're unlikely to be able to watch the game like you normally would at home, thanks to geoblocking. 

There's one option to get around this. By using a VPN, as explained above, you can set your location to a country where the match is being broadcast and go from there.

If you want to stream this EPL game live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to Fubo Canada. The service has exclusive rights to every Premier League match once again this season.

Quick tips for streaming the Premier League using a VPN 
With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming EPL matches may vary.
If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the "search for city or country" option.
If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.
All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. 
And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We normally recommend Brave.
